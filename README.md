# Data Layout #

I was using layout that is recomended in PGN standard. There is some adaptations:

* All my  games will be stored in _data/pgn/mgr;
* All other players will be stored in _data/pgn/players;
* All filenames will be a timestamp;
** If a game was played at Santa Rosália Bakery and the times is unknow then time will be set at 19:00:00;
** Exercise and other cases, the unknow time will be set to 00:00:00;
